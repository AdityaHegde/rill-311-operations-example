# Rill Developer example project for 311 operations
An example demonstrating operational analytics for 311 call centers in the California Bay Area.

## Getting started

Make sure you have installed Rill

```
curl -s https://cdn.rilldata.com/install.sh | bash
```

Run the following commands to clone the repository and start Rill:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/rilldata/rill-311-operations-example.git
cd rill-311-operations-example
rill start
```

The initial call to `rill start` may take a while depending on your network connection as it downloads some large remote CSV files.
